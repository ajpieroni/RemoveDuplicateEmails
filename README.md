# Remove Duplicate Emails
## How to Use:

-  Ensure you have python3 installed, you can check by typing `which python3` in your terminal
- Clone this repository, and in the same folder, add your input csv
- Be sure to replace the last few lines of the file with your input file, and what you want your output file to be names
- Then, you can run `python3 [path]/main.py`. I've included my path as a reference.

Enjoy!
